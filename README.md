# Automated Flight Schedule Data Collection at Changi Airport
The scripts scrape the arrival and departure flight schedule on specified dates. The scripts run with Selenium and BeautifulSoup

## Description:
For this project, I developed a robust solution to collect and organize flight schedule data from Changi Airport's website. Leveraging Python libraries BeautifulSoup and Selenium, I implemented a web scraping tool capable of extracting essential information such as date, time, flight number, airline name, airport name, and boarding status.

## Challenge:
Changi Airport's website provided valuable real-time flight information but lacked an easy-to-access data export feature. Manual data collection was time-consuming and prone to errors, necessitating an automated solution to streamline the process.

## Solution:
I utilized BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content and extracting flight details from the airport's website. Additionally, Selenium was employed to navigate dynamic elements, ensuring comprehensive data retrieval, even for pages requiring user interaction (e.g., loading more flights by scrolling). This approach enabled seamless and efficient extraction of pertinent flight information.

## Outcome:
The automated data collection system significantly enhanced productivity and accuracy in gathering Changi Airport's flight schedule data. By eliminating the need for manual data entry, the project saved valuable time and resources while ensuring up-to-date and reliable information for analysis and decision-making. This project showcases my proficiency in Python programming and demonstrates my ability to develop effective solutions for data collection and analysis tasks.
